Cloud Service Analyzer

A web application that will allow users to fill out a form on their current cloud service plan or a cloud service plan they are planning to purchase. The form data will then be sent to multiple cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and GCP using their respective cloud billing APIs to get pricing info. The info will finally be processed and returned to show how much the user can save on cloud costs by implementing various optimization strategies or switching to a different cloud service provider altogether.
